# Theory vs. Practice

- List 3 reasons why asymptotic analysis may be misleading with respect to
  actual performance in practice.

- Suppose finding a particular element in a binary search tree with 1,000
  elements takes 5 seconds. Given what you know about the asymptotic complexity
  of search in a binary search tree, how long would you guess finding the same
  element in a search tree with 10,000 elements takes? Explain your reasoning.

- You measure the time with 10,000 elements and it takes 100 seconds! List 3
  reasons why this could be the case, given that reasoning with the asymptotic
  complexity suggests a different time.

1a) The first reason I can think of as to why the asymptotic analysis may be misleading with respect to actual performace is obviously hardware.
In many cases theory depends on the ideal conditions to any given experiment, but the one thing that varies most user to user in my mind is hardware.
Many people can run programs much faster if the hardware is better, a computer that that is 2 months old is almost assuredly faster than the 5 year old computer
with faster calculating compentents and a greater memory capacity.
